# price-prediction-videogame
The project focused on predicting video game sales based on historical data extracted from a CSV file containing information on video game sales.

-Utilized Python programming language and popular data manipulation libraries to preprocess and analyze the video game sales data.

-Applied machine learning techniques, including regression algorithms, to develop a predictive model for estimating video game sales.

-Conducted feature engineering to extract valuable information and enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

-Employed appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the performance and accuracy of the developed predictive model.
